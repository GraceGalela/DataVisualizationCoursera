# DataVisualizationCourseraPA1

This is my submission for the Data Visualization Coursera Programming Assignment 1

The data used for this assignment is GISTEMP from NASA

I used a free online data visualization site to make this called datavisu.al.
As for the data set, I altered them a bit to make a tidy and direct graph through a line graph

Explanation:
This graph visualizes the GISTEMP data for the Globe, the North and South Hemispheres from 1880 - 2014.
The Blue line is for the Globe, Green line for the Northern Hemisphere and the Red for the South Hemisphere.
My x-axis are the years 1880-2014 while my y-axis is the temperature.

From this, I can see from 1880 to 1920 there have been a series of ups and downs of the temperature although there are still negative degrees
And right after that an increasing trend happened till 1944. Then it goes downward for sometime but now it is above 0 degree
and then it keeps on increasing till 2008.
Same trend happening for the three: global, north, and south. 
As it goes on, there's an increasting temperature happening.
